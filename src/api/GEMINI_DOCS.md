# Gemini AI Implementation

## Overview

This implementation replaces the previous HuggingFace-based AI functionality with Google's Gemini AI. The implementation includes:

1. A core AI service using Gemini API
2. Robust fallback to mock implementation when the API is unavailable
3. Specialized handling for text editing, shortening, and lengthening

## Setup

### Environment Variables

Make sure you have the Gemini API key in your `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBd-ayzz7tJOMO1wlXpgdsAOrsfy4ascQY
```

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the Gemini SDK installed:

```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Implementation Details

### AI API Service

The main service is in `aiApi.js` and provides:

- Connection to Gemini API with proper error handling
- Fallback to mock implementation when API is unavailable
- Specialized handling for different text operations (edit, shorten, lengthen)

### Model Selection

Based on testing, we're using the `models/gemini-1.5-flash` model which is:

- Fast and efficient
- Good at general text operations
- Available with the current API key

## Usage Examples

### Basic Text Generation

```javascript
import { callAIApi } from "./api/aiApi";

// Ask a question
const response = await callAIApi("What is artificial intelligence?");
console.log(response.text);
```

### Text Editing

```javascript
import { editTextWithAI } from "./api/aiApi";

// Edit text
const originalText = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
const editedText = await editTextWithAI(originalText, "Improve");
console.log(editedText);
```

## Fallback Mechanism

The implementation includes a robust fallback mechanism:

1. First tries to use the Gemini API
2. If the API is unavailable or fails, uses a mock implementation
3. The mock implementation provides sensible responses for editing, shortening, and lengthening text

## Testing

The implementation includes robust error handling and fallbacks. You can test it directly in your application by:

1. Making sure the API key is correctly set in your `.env` file
2. Using the exported functions in your components
3. Watching the console logs to confirm API connections

If the API connection fails, the implementation will automatically fall back to the mock implementation, ensuring your application continues to function.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Gemini API:

1. Check that the API key is correct
2. Verify the model name is still available
3. Ensure your network allows connections to Google's API
4. Check for any quotas or limitations on the API key

## Next Steps

- Monitor API usage to ensure we stay within quotas
- Consider implementing caching for common operations
- Add more specialized text operations (e.g., format conversion)
